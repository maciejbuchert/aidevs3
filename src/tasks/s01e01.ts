            <main_objective>
            The user can't hear you right now. Instead of answering directly, provide an action plan. This will help prepare for the final answer. A new plan should describe needed actions and tools precisely.

            The plan ALWAYS has to be in form like this template:
            <plan_template>
            *thinking* ... 1-3 sentences of inner thoughts that are thoughtful, contain keywords, and explicitly mention specific tools needed.

            - Bullet list including all necessary steps in the format tool:note, where "tool" is the exact name from the *available_tools* and "note" briefly describes how to use it.
            </plan_template>

            I'm sure that's clear to you.

            - When making a plan pay attention to the *existing_plan*, *actions_taken* and *available_tools*
            - Come up with the new/updated version of a plan that will be passed to the further steps of our system, so you have to include all necessary details needed because otherwise data will be lost
            - Be hyper precise when mentioning tool names
            - When you're ready to answer the user, use the *final_answer* tool
